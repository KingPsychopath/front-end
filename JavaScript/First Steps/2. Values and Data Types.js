// "Tic Tac Toe", 9 and "#board" are all values.
// The first is a string, the second is a number, and the third is a string that represents a CSS selector.

// Values are pieces of data that are stored in variables.
// They can be of different types, such as strings, numbers, and booleans.

// Strings are sequences of characters, such as "Hello, World!".
// Numbers are numerical values, such as 42 or 3.14.
// Booleans are true or false values.

// Data types are categories of values. The three most common data types are strings, numbers, and booleans.

// The typeof operator can be used to find the data type of a value.
typeof "Hello, World!" // "string"
typeof 42 // "number"
typeof true // "boolean"

// JavaScript also has a special value called undefined, which is used to represent the absence of a value.
typeof undefined // "undefined"
// The null value is used to represent the absence of a value as well, but it is a different type than undefined.
typeof null // "object"

// Undefined and Null both represent the absence of a value
// However, null is deliberate and assigned by a programmer, while undefined is assigned by JavaScript itself.


// JavaScript has two kinds of data types: primitive and object.
// Primitive data types include strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
// Object data types include objects(e.g. document), arrays, and functions.
