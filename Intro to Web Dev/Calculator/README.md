# Calculator

This is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It uses a `Stack` to keep track of the operations and numbers entered by the user.

It was built to look similar to the default calculator app on iOS.

While there are still some kinks, and I have not implemented the exponents properly, I am proud of the progress I have made so far.
